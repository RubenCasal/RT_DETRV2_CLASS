## üìå Parameters  

| Parameter                       | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **num_labels**                  | Number of classes the model needs to predict.                               |
| **id2label / label2id**         | Ensure predictions are correctly translated into human-readable labels.      |
| **backbone**                    | Defines the base network used as feature extractor (e.g., `microsoft/resnet-50`). |
| **use_pretrained_backbone**     | Controls whether to start from pretrained weights (e.g., ImageNet) or train from scratch. |
| **freeze_backbone_batch_norms** | Option to freeze BatchNorm layers to stabilize training.                     |
| **backbone_kwargs (out_indices)** | Selects which backbone layers are used to generate feature maps (e.g., stages 1, 2, and 3 of ResNet). |
| **encoder_in_channels**         | Number of channels the encoder receives from the backbone.                   |
| **feat_strides**                | Defines the scales at which objects are analyzed (e.g., `[8, 16, 32]`).      |
| **decoder_method**              | Strategy used by the decoder to process queries (e.g., `"discrete"`).        |
